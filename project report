Hey! Here's What I Built
I made a small but super useful console-based tool called Student Grade Management System. Imagine a mini version of what your class teacher uses to keep track of marks – but I coded it from scratch using only Python!
Instead of losing all the data when the program closes (like most beginner projects), mine remembers everything by saving it into a file called students.txt. Open it tomorrow, and all your students are still there!

What My Project Can Do

Add a new student (Roll No, Name, Age, Course)
Show the full list with average marks and letter grade
Add or update marks for any subject
Automatically calculate grades (A+, A, B+, etc.)
Crown the topper of the class
Delete a student (if someone drops out)
Everything gets saved automatically – no data loss!


Tech Stuff (But Simple)

Pure Python – no extra downloads needed!
Used classes (OOP feels cool now)
Data saved in a normal text file (students.txt)
Clean folders and files so it looks professional


How I Organized Everything
textStudent_Grade_Management_System/
├── main.py           ← Where the magic starts
├── students.txt      ← Your data lives here forever
├── README.md         ← Quick guide for anyone
└── src/
    ├── student.py        ← The Student "blueprint"
    ├── grade_manager.py  ← Brain of the project
    └── utils.py          ← Makes the screen look pretty

My Favorite Part of the Code
Pythondef get_grade(self):
    avg = self.get_average()
    if avg >= 90: return 'A+'
    elif avg >= 80: return 'A'
    # ... and so on
This tiny function instantly tells if someone got an A+ or needs to study harder – feels like real grading!

What It Looks Like When Running

           STUDENT GRADE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM               
         Developed by Rajat - VIT Bhopal                
============================================================

1. Add Student
2. View All Students
3. Add/Update Marks
4. View Topper
5. Delete Student
6. Exit



What I Learned (Real Talk)

How to save data so it doesn’t disappear
Classes are actually useful (not just theory)
Writing clean code makes life 10x easier
Small projects can feel super satisfying when they just work


Future Ideas (If I Get More Time)

Add a graphical window (maybe with Tkinter)
Let teachers log in with a password
Generate PDF report cards
Search students by name
Add attendance too!


Final Words
This was my first proper Python project that feels like a real mini-application. It’s simple, but it works perfectly, saves data, and looks neat. I’m really proud of it!
Thank you for checking it out!
Made with lots of coffee and zero external libraries
